# Continuous Delivery
- The practice of automatically deploying code changes to a staging or testing environment where they can be validated
# Continuous Deployment
- Extends continuous delivery by automatically deploying every change that passes the tests to the production environment.

## Benefits of Continuous Delivery and Deployment
- Faster time to market
- Reduced Deployment Risks
- Improved Productivity
- Consistent User Experience

Even if there's a bug that goes through, it will be checked at the later processes.


Suitability of CI/CD
- Best suited for agile teams with iterative, fast-paced development cycles

Less suitable for
- legacy systems that are hard to refactor
- low change environment or projects where stability is more important than rapid updates.
- Highly regulated industries.

> Effective is quick while efficient is less resources used but still does the same job.
